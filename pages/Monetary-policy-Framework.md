- Monetary policy refers to the use of monetary instruments under the control of the central bank to influence variables, such as interest rates, money supply and availability of credit, with a view to achieving price stability.
### Instruments: 
- The LAF consists of overnight as well as term repo/reverse repo auctions. Progressively, the Reserve Bank has increased the proportion of liquidity injected under variable rate repo auctions across the range of tenors. The aim of term-repo is to help develop the inter-bank term-money market, which in turn can set market-based benchmarks for pricing of loans and deposits, and hence improve transmission of monetary policy.
- (MSF): A facility under which scheduled commercial banks can borrow additional amount of overnight money from the Reserve Bank against their excess SLR securities and also by dipping into their SLR portfolio up to a specified limit at a penal rate of interest.
- Bank Rate: It is the standard rate at which the Reserve Bank is ready to ==buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers.== Changes automatically along with MSF.
- Open Market Operations (OMOs): These include both repurchase (repo or reverse repo) operations and outright purchase and sale of government securities, for injection and absorption of liquidity, respectively.
- MSS: Surplus liquidity of a more enduring nature arising from large capital inflows is absorbed through sale of short-dated government securities and treasury bills.
### Evolution of Monetary Policy Framework in India:
- Monetary policy framework consists of:
	- **objectives**- The goal variable is usually not within direct control of the bank, so it is indirectly controlled through influencing operating targets.
	- **operating procedure**- the day-to-day management of liquidity conditions consistent with the overall stance of the monetary policy.
	- **governance arrangements**- deals with  responsibilities, powers and accountability of the monetary authority.
- **Early 70s:** During 1971-1985, the monetisation of the fiscal deficit exerted a dominant influence on the conduct of monetary policy. the resultant inflationary consequences of high public expenditure necessitated frequent recourse to the CRR to neutralize the secondary effects of monetary expansion.
- **Monetary Targeting Framework:
	- Dr. Sukhamoy Chakravarty recommended in 1985 a new monetary policy framework based on monetary targeting with feedback, drawing on empirical evidence of a stable demand function for money. 
	- Under this framework, broad money became the intermediate target while reserve money was one of the main operating instruments for achieving control on broad money growth. Accordingly, monetary (M3) projection was made consistent with the expected real GDP growth and a tolerable level of inflation.
	- The biggest impediment to monetary targeting was lack of control over RBI's credit to the central government, which accounted for the bulk of reserve money creation.
- **1991 reforms and birth of Multiple indicator approach:** 
	- RBI was able to move away from direct instruments to indirect market-based instruments. The SLR and CRR were gradually brought down to 25 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively by 1997.
	- The RBI adopted a 'multiple indicator approach' in April 1998 with a greater emphasis on rate channels for monetary policy formulation relative to quantity instruments. Under this approach, a number of quantity variables such as money, credit, output, trade, capital flows and fiscal position as well as rate variables such as rates of return in different markets, inflation rate and exchange rate were analysed for drawing monetary policy perspectives.
	- The multiple indicator approach seemed to work fairly well from 1998-99 to 2008-09, as reflected in the average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 7.1 per cent associated with average inflation of about 5.5 per cent in terms of both the wholesale price index (WPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Subsequently, however, there was a mounting public censure of the efficacy and even the credibility of this framework as persistently high inflation and weakening growth co-existed, i.e., visible signs of stagflation.
- **FIT 2013:**
	- In the flexible inflation targeting framework, the policy (repo) rate is set, based on an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, with the aim of achieving the inflation target on an average over the business cycle, while accommodating growth concerns in the short run (RBI, 2014).
	- RBI envisages liquidity management on a day-to-day basis through appropriate actions, which aim at anchoring the operating target – WACR – around the repo rate. The amended RBI act of 2016 provides statutory basis for execution of inflation targeting framework.
- **Current Scenario**:
	- The RBI has started implementing some of the unconventional monetary policy measures from December 2019 onwards to arrest the economic slowdown and improve the investment cycle in India. The reliance on unconventional monetary policy measures increased in February 2020 to reduce the impact of Corona virus outbreak on economic activity. **Operation twist** is one of the unconventional monetary policy measures adopted by the RBI since December 2019 under which the RBI simultaneously sells short-term securities and buys long-term securities through open market operations (OMO). This measure is aimed at bringing down the long-term benchmark yield rate. RBI has also introduced measures aimed at durable liquidity injections to the banking system through long-term repo operations (LTRO) with the tenor of one year and three year at reasonable cost, i.e., the repo rate. RBI has also implemented sector-specific measures such as exemptions from the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for the equivalent of incremental credit disbursed by banks as loans in certain select areas/segments and targeted LTROs (TLTROs) to provide liquidity to sectors and entities which are experiencing liquidity constraints and/or hindrances to market access.
### Monetary policy transmission in India:
- Monetary transmission is the process through which monetary policy impulses in the form of policy rate changes by a central bank are transmitted to the entire spectrum of interest rates such as money market rates, bond yields, bank deposit and lending rates and asset prices such as stock prices and house prices. Various economic agents such as households, firms and the government respond to these interest rate changes by adjusting their spending behaviour. This alters aggregate demand of households and firms and by aligning it with aggregate supply conditions, the broader macroeconomic policy objectives such as price stability and sustainable growth of the economy are achieved. The whole process takes months, sometimes, more than a year.
- The empirical evidence for India suggests that monetary policy actions are felt with a lag of 2-3 quarters on output and with a lag of 3-4 quarters on inflation, and the impact persists for 8-12 quarters.
- Transmission takes place through various ‘channels’, namely (i) interest rate channel,(strongest) (ii) credit channel, (iii) exchange rate channel, and (iv) asset price channel. 
- The efficacy of monetary policy depends on the magnitude and the speed with which policy rate changes are transmitted to the ultimate objectives of monetary policy, viz., growth and inflation.
- In a bank dominated system like India, the transmission to banks’ lending rates is the key to the successful implementation of monetary policy. Hence, it has been the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to strengthen the monetary transmission by focusing on the design of the lending interest rates of the banking system. It is with this view that RBI has directed banks to link loans to MSMEs to external benchmarks. Banks are free to choose the spread over the benchmark as per the credit risk in question.
